# Introduction

## Joyful Automation by AI

UI automation testing is often difficult to maintain, which often involves a maze of *#ids*, *data-test* attributes, and *.selectors*. When it comes to refactoring, it can be a nightmare.

Introducing Midscene.js, an innovative SDK designed to bring joy back to automation scripts by simplifying the commands.

Midscene.js leverages a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) to intuitively ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù your user interface and carry out the necessary actions. You can simply describe the interaction steps or expected data formats, and the AI will handle the execution for you.

## Interact, query and assert by natural language

There are three main capabilities: action (`.ai`, `.aiAction`), query (`.aiQuery`), assert(`.aiAssert`).

* Use `.ai` to execute a series of actions by describing the steps
* Use `.aiQuery` to extract customized data from the UI. Just describe the JSON format you want, and AI will give the answer based on its "understand" of the page
* Use `.aiAssert` to perform assertions on the page.

All these methods accept natural language prompt as param. Obviously, the cost of script maintenance will be greatly decreased.

For example 

```typescript
// üëÄ type keywords, perform a search
await ai('type "Headphones" in search box, hit Enter');

// üëÄ find the items, return in JSON
const items = await aiQuery(
  "{itemTitle: string, price: Number}[], find item in list and corresponding price"
);

console.log("headphones in stock", items);

// üëÄ assert by natural language
await aiAssert("There is a category filter on the left");
```

## Visualized Report

Midscene will provide a visual report after each run. With this report, you can review the replay and view the details of each step in the process.

## Playground for debug

Midscene provides a playground for debug. You can run and debug any prompt with the type `Action` `Query` `Assert` in it.

Usually, you can launch a playground from your report file. You can also launch one using the Chrome extension to interact with any webpage.

## Compatible with existing tools

You can integrate Midscene.js with projects like Playwright or Puppeteer. Just introduce innovative features into popular automation tools.

## Just you and model provider, no third-party services

‚Å†Midscene.js is an open-source project (GitHub: [Midscene](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/midscene/)) under the MIT license. You can run it in your own environment. All data gathered from pages will be sent directly to OpenAI or the custom model provider according to your configuration. Therefore, only you and the model provider will have access to the data. No third-party platform will access the data.
