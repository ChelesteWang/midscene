# Experience By Chrome Extension (coming soon)

By using the Midscene.js Chrome extension, you can quickly experience the main features of Midscene on any webpage, without needing to set up a code project.

## Preparation

Prepare an OpenAI API key, we will use it soon.

## Install and config

Install Midscene extension from chrome extension store:  (It's still in review, will come soon.)

Start the extension (may be folded by default), setup the config by pasting the config in the K=V format:

```shell
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-replace-by-your-own"
```

You can also paste the configuration as described in [customize model provider](../usage/model-provider.html) here.

## Start experiencing

After the configuration, you can immediately experience Midscene. You can use actions to interact with the page, use queries to extract JSON data, or use assertions to validate. 

You may notice that the extension will provide a playback of actions and a report file to review. This is the same report file you will receive from your automation scripts.

Enjoy !

## Want to write some code ?

After experiencing, you may want to write some code to integrate Midscene. There are multiple ways to do that. Please refer to the documents below:

* Use [Command Line Tools]('./cli')
* [Integrate with Puppeteer]('./integrate-with-puppeteer')
* [Integrate with Playwright]('./integrate-with-playwright')
